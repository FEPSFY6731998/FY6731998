<h3 style=”font-family:calibri:”><b>Introduction</b></h3>
      <p1> Thousands of helicopters are used every day with varying designs. I was intrigued by the complex intricacies of how a helicopter flies and how the rotor blades interact with the air. In this paper I research how a helicopter works aerodynamically the benefits and drawbacks of three rotor types. The three different designs of rotors that I research are the tandem rotor, coaxial rotor and single rotor with a tail rotor (Seddon and Newman, 2011). I also mention the practicality of each type of rotor design and where they are commonly used.  </p1>

<h4 style=”font-family:calibri:”><b>Basic Helicopter Aerodynamics:</b></h4>
      <p2> Firstly, looking at basic helicopter aerodynamics. The turbine engine starts rotating which drives the transmission and causes the rotor to start spinning. Using Bernoulli’s principle (Breithaupt, 2015) the low velocity – high pressure air underneath the blade causes lift. The rotor blades can be tilted at an angle, and this directs the air causing thrust (Cadence, N.D.).   </p2>     

<h5 style=”font-family:calibri:”><b>Basic Helicopter Aerodynamics:</b></h5>
      <p3> The first rotor type I researched was the single rotor with a tail rotor design. The force of the main rotor spinning creates torque and exerts a force onto the main body of the helicopter that would make it spin with equal force in the opposite direction (Cadence, N.D.). The tail rotor resolves this and is designed to produce an equal force in the opposite plane and direction to counteract this force. The tail rotor also adds manoeuvrability as you can apply more power to the tail rotor, causing the helicopter to yaw (X-axis rotation) at a controlled rate (see figure 1). The single rotor and tail rotor system is the most commonly used design in helicopters (Chopper Spotter, 2023)  as it is relatively lightweight, a simpler design, only one transmission is needed and therefore it is cheaper compared to other designs. Figure 1 (Diagram showing a tandem rotor helicopter demonstrating yaw, pitch and roll) (Tech Model Products, 2009) A disadvantage of this design is called dissymmetry of lift, and it is a problem that occurs when the lift applied to the front and rear side of the rotor is unbalanced (Macronomics, 2018). This only occurs in forward flight as the “advancing blade has a higher airspeed than the retreating blade” (Macronomics, 2018). As the retreating blade has less lift due to this slower airspeed, the front of the helicopter can pitch up because of this imbalance (Macronomics, 2018). Dissymmetry of lift can be very dangerous if the pilot cannot react fast enough.	 </p3>
